@echo off
:: run_local.bat — launcher for WSL2+Windows local dev setup.
::
:: Instead of pushing directly to the OpenContext daemon (which lives inside WSL2 and
:: is not reachable from Windows), this runs the collector in --dry-run mode
:: and appends JSON events to a shared file that the WSL2 bridge can read.
::
:: Usage: double-click or call from Task Scheduler.
:: Pair with: bridge.sh running inside WSL2.
